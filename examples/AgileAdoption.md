# Agile Adoption

**Target**: Team begins with Kanban and adopts additional processes in response to specific team needs.

**User Story**: As a project leader, I have heard of teams that have adopted Agile workflows and significant success, and others that have had a very
negative experience. Therefore, I want to capture the advantages of Agile without wasting time on unnecessary overhead so that I can improve
the productivity of my team.
